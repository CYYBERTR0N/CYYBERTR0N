&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; **FICTION**KIN OF DAISY . , NOT A SYSTEM . DIAGNOSED WITH OSDD BUT NOT A SYSTEM.

&emsp; &emsp;  Minor , Not comfy saying age. 

&emsp;  **Bisexual** , Nonbinary . She / They pronouns

&emsp; &emsp; I do not know the things i say sometimes , And wont know that your uncomfy with one of my jokes unless it is told to me directly . I take full responsibility for what i say however.

&emsp; Yes, I ship Pizzapunch / Paycheck. I do not force ships on others, Nor will i try and rp ships with people. Im private about my ships mostly. + Im neutral on most ships , And i am **NOT** Weird about ships.

&emsp;&emsp; I tend to go silent at times, Likely means i've dissociated or just very zoned out . I will not reply to whispers / comments made to me until ive snapped back to reality. I also have emotional dysregulation. No, I do not know when i dissociate or zone out. I zone out as a coping mechanism, And I heavily dissociate.

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Do not interact with me if you use letters in words / Have Eyestrain skins. I have a severely sensitive right eye and i use a screenreader. I will not try to start a conversation with you.

&emsp; I rarely WILL Rp ships with you, As i do not very much enjoy ship rps . Nor do i like forced ship rps , They make me uncomfy.
